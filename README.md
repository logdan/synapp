# SynApp

This is a library intended to simplify the process of recording and analyzing neural sensor data.

By using practices and principles from the Software Engineering industry, we aim
to empower researchers to record data in consistent, scalable ways.

One of the primary goals of this library is to allow interacting with any sensor the same way.
Once a driver for the device and a derived Device class is created, all of the code in this library
for recording and analyzing data will be usable without modification.

The author of this library, Logan Danek, produced the alpha version of this work as part of his
Master's Thesis, "Analysis of Modern Neural Sensors for Application in Real-Time Brain-Computer Interfaces".
