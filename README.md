# SynApp

This is a library intended to simplify the process of recording and analyzing neural sensor data.

By using practices and principles from the Software Engineering industry, we aim
to empower researchers to record data in consistent, scalable ways.

One of the primary goals of this library is to allow interacting with any sensor the same way.
Once a driver for the device and a derived Device class is created, all of the code in this library
for recording and analyzing data will be usable without modification.

The author of this library, Logan Danek, produced an early version of this work as part of his
Master's Thesis, "Analysis of Modern Neural Sensors for Application in Real-Time Brain-Computer Interfaces".

It is still maintained and updated by the author - please add suggestions and improvements!

## Getting Started

## Examples
In the `examples` directory, there are scripts that can be run directly from the command line. Run them with `--help` to see what they do
and what the inputs are. Additionally, there are jupyter notebooks that can be run on either the sample data or a device you own.
The notebooks are a great way to get a feel for the functionality of the library.
